<h2 id="intro"> Introduction </h2>

- BlackJack is a game of chance where the player tries to reach a sum of 21 with their card values, without going over
- The player is opposed by a dealer, who plays by the same rules
- Whoever gets closer to 21 wins

But that&#39;s gambling, we can&#39;t allow that...

- Counting cards makes it a game of skill
- But it&#39;s hard and requires thinking

<strong>Introducing: QuHackJack</strong>

<h2 id="concepts"> Game Concepts </h2>

- Use quantum computer to generate all random numbers
- Random numbers correspond to playing cards being drawn
- Allow the user to manipulate the quantum circuit before drawing a card, to change their odds

<h2 id="rules"> Rules </h2>

- deck of 32 cards, values 3 to 10 and suits ♣, ♠, ♥, ♦
- The player and dealer compete to reach as close as possible to a total of 16, without going over
- Each card corresponds to a 5 q-bit computational basis state
- Random outcomes are achieved through a single hadamard gate on each q-bit

- Different gamemodes allow player to apply different types &amp; numbers of gates

<strong>Gamemodes:</strong>

EASY<br>MEDIUM<br>HARD<br>ULTRA<br>NOGATENOCRY<br>WATERGATE<br>
Some have no element of luck, others have some! All require a good amount of puzzling.

<ul>
<li>Comprehensive UI messages and tons of introduction</li>

<h3 id="achievements">Achievements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Created a fully-fletched, <em>fun</em> game</li>
<li>Useful as a teaching device (tried and tested on friends &amp; family)</li>
<li>Extensive documentation of quantum computing concepts &amp; independent exploration of different gates</li>
<li>Very fun puzzle game (We have spent some time puzzling ourselves)</li>
<li>Tons of variety through random 1st cards &amp; different gamemodes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="potential-improvements">Potential improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Limited to a non-standard deck by the use of q-bit basis</li>
<li>Hardware noise may mess with the user, even if all the gates are correct (<em>It&#39;s NISQ, Baby!</em>)</li>
<li>Queued jobs make the game quite slow</li>
<li>The victory, loss messages could use some work</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thoughts-reflections">Thoughts &amp; Reflections</h3>
<ul>
<li>Incredible Experience throughout</li>
<li>Extremely creative &amp; fun challenge (Thanks @Microsoft &amp; @IonQ)</li>
<li>Met people from all across the world (4 people, 4 timezones &amp; countries)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Thank you!</strong>
