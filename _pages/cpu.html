<p>This is the source code that was created for my 2020 Computational Physics module Project (Project 4).
It can be used to simulate the temperature in a CPU with different configurations for Heat Sinks and convection cooling.
For any questions or requests, <a href="mailto:karimaed@gmx.de">contact me.</a></p>
<p>The separation into subfolders was intended, but made counterproductive by pythons default behaviour regarding imports.</p>
<p>The report for this can be found <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/scbnbrjtfbvb">here</a>.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: The issue with figures not showing up during runtime is known. See &quot;Troubleshooting&quot; for more information.</p>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<p>The project was written in python 3.8 and requires new features available from it to run. It was developed in the anaconda 3 environment using spyder 4.
The project has only been tested under Windows 10, but should run reliably there.</p>
<p>It furthermore requires the following python packages:
    numpy
    matplotlib
    time (standard package)
    abc (standard package)
    dataclasses (standard package)
    unittest (standard package)</p>
<p>If any of these are not installed, you can install them with either:</p>
<p>pip install packagename</p>
<p>or if you are using anaconda:</p>
<p>conda install packagename</p>
<h2 id="running-the-code">Running the Code</h2>
<p>In order to run the code, you can use the prepackaged interface from main.py, which is used to reproduce all of the actual results
presented in the results section of the project report. They should be sufficient for default systems with the same material specifications as in the aforementioned
report. This includes:</p>
<pre><code>main() wrapper <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">that</span> handles dynamic user input -&gt; This <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> the easiest entrypoint, <span class="hljs-keyword">others</span> can be called from here

run_presets() <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>, which runs <span class="hljs-keyword">all</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> the presets plotted <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the report (huge, slow system <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> optional)

run_system() <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">to</span> model any system <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> default materials <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> settings

optimise() <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">to</span> perform grid search over specified heat sink parameter ranges

calls to the test_all() <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title"></span>(see "Tests and Validations" below)
</code></pre><p>Here, the NewtonSolver is used exclusively as the ExactSolver and RelaxationSolver are deprecated (See manual systems or tests and validations for their usage).</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If the figures do not appear when running from the main loop function, this is due to matplotlib not rendering while the loop runs. For this, either call the functions
directly and not from the loop, or simply terminate the loop (not python, just exit the loop as intended) and the plots will appear.</p>
<h2 id="tests-and-validations">Tests and Validations</h2>
<p>Files for testing and validation of all the functions and classes are included in the package (under test_file.py). These can be used to extensively test
not only the base behaviour of methods and classes, but also their agreement etc. The exact test files are:</p>
<pre><code>test_linalg.py (<span class="hljs-keyword">For</span> manual linear algebra solver <span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>-consistency <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> agreement <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> numpy.linalg solver)
test_system.py (<span class="hljs-keyword">For</span> proper system setup <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> taking invalid parameters)
test_method.py (<span class="hljs-keyword">For</span> testing <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> proper setup <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> agreement <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> the different methods (ExactSolver, RelaxationSolver <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> NewtonSolver))
test_resolution.py (<span class="hljs-keyword">For</span> testing insignificant improvements <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> resolutions larger than <span class="hljs-number">2</span>)
vboundaries.py (<span class="hljs-keyword">For</span> testing the differences between the two boundary condition schemes: <span class="hljs-keyword">forward</span>- <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> central-difference)

testing.py (<span class="hljs-keyword">For</span> running all <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> the tests consecutively)
</code></pre><p>The tests can also all be run from the main.py file through the test_all() function from testing.py</p>
<h2 id="manual-system-creation">Manual System Creation</h2>
<p>Alternatively, completely custom systems can be set up very easily by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Define all of you materials through the Material Dataclass from system.py:
 Air, the Processor, Case, and optionally the Heat Sink. (Custom parameters for power and conductivity can be passed)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Group these materials in a list of length 3 (without heat sink) or 4 (with heat sink).</p>
</li>
<li><p>(Optional) create a heat sink, either with 10 fins, 2mm apart and 20mm long each or pass custom parameters for these features.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Initialise and name your system through the System dataclass from system.py. Choose a resolution (minimum 2)
 This automatically creates a layout, which can be called with the show() method on the dataclass.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose your parameters (Convection mode, Boundary Condition option, manual or numpy linear algebra solver and possibly forced convection wind speed)
 and call your preferred solver.Here, there are the following options:</p>
<pre><code> ExactSolver (<span class="hljs-keyword">deprecated</span>, only works <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Forward</span>-Difference-Scheme BCs <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> Forced convection)
 RelaxationSolver (<span class="hljs-keyword">deprecated</span>, slow)

 NewtonSolver (preferred <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> all cases)
</code></pre><p> These all automatically initialise a heat map and generate all the linear algebra equations required for solving the equations. You can also use the
 show() method on them to plot a heat map.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally call solve() method on your Solver, where you can choose from the list of parameters, which linear algebra to use, which error to use as
 the convergence criterion etc. (See help(YourChosenSolver.solve))</p>
</li>
</ol>
