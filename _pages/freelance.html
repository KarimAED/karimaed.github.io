<p>I am a registered freelancer in Germany for software development, data science and product management.
  Generally, I prefer to work on a milestone basis, reflecting my achievements rather than time spent. My specializations are: </p>
<ol>
<li>Data science/machine learning with the regular Python stack (Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Tensorflow or Pytorch)</li>
<li>Production-ready coding with linting, version control, testing, code coverage and CI/CD</li>
<li>Full-stack development of cross-platform apps in Flutter / TypeScript</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, I am a licensed Azure data science associate and Upwork certified talent.</p>
