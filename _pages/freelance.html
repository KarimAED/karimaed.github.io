<p>I am a registered freelancer in Germany for software development, data science and product management. My regular hourly rate lies at 20â‚¬,
but if the project is interesting enough or you don't have the means to afford this rate, contact me and discounts could apply.</p>

<p>Generally, I prefer to work on a milestone basis, reflecting my achievements rather than time spent. My specializations are data science/machine learning with the
regular Python stack (Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Tensorflow or Pytorch), production-ready coding with linting, version control, testing, code coverage and CI/CD,
 and the full-stack development of cross-platform apps in Flutter / TypeScript. Furthermore, I am a licensed Azure data science associate.</p>
