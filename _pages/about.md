Hi there, I'm Karim! üëã


Thank you for checking out my website. I am a PhD candidate at the University of Oxford, in the field of Atomic and Laser Physics.
My specialization is the use of machine learning with differentiable density functional theory, and I hold a Master of Science degree
from Imperial College London.

Furthermore, I am a passionate data scientist and software developer, working as a freelancer with multiple clients on a
range of different projects, from production-ready machine learning pipelines, to full-stack app development, and online challenges.
My experience with best practices, in combination with my passion for learning new things has allowed me to contribute to
winning submissions for both the [Imperial College AIHack 2021][ai-hack] and the [MIT iQuHack 2022][iquhack], focussing on AI and quantum
computing respectively.

Outside of studies and work, I like to volunteer, especially as a youth worker and teacher. 2023. In my leisure, I like to read, code/programüñ•, go bouldering, swimmingüèä, Scuba divingü§ø or do Judoü•ã.


Feel free to contact me about anything at all,
I love to encounter new ideas, opportunities and challenges.
