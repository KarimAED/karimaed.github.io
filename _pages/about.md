Hi there, I'm Karim! üëã


Thank you for checking out my website. I am a final-year Master's student at Imperial College London studying physics with theoretical physics.
My specialization is the study of dynamic many-body quantum systems with machine learning.
Furthermore, I am an excellent data science/machine learning and app development
freelancer with extensive experience in production-ready development and deployment with version control,
linting, CI/CD, unit tests and proper code coverage. In addition, I excel at machine learning and quantum
computing applications, which has led me to win both the Imperial College AIHack 2021 and the MIT iQuHack 2022.
Outside of studies and work, I like to volunteer, especially as a youth worker and teacher. 2023. In my leisure, I like to read, code/program, go bouldering, swimming, Scuba diving or do Judo.
