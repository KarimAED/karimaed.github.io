Hi there, I'm Karim!


Thank you for checking out my website. I am a final-year Master's student at Imperial College London studying physics with theoretical physics.
My specialization is the study of dynamic many-body quantum systems with machine learning. Furthermore, I am an excellent data science/machine learning and app development freelancer with extensive experience in production-ready development and deployment with version control, linting, CI/CD, unit tests and proper code coverage. In addition, I excel at machine learning and quantum computing applications, which has led me to win both the Imperial College AIHack 2021 and the MIT iQuHack 2022. Outside of studies and work, I like to volunteer, especially as a youth worker and teacher. In my leisure, I like to read, code/program, go bouldering, swimming or do Judo.

Feel free to contact me about anything at all, I love to encounter new ideas, opportunities and challenges. If you are interested in hiring me, please click [here](https://karimaed.github.io/hire/). Alternatively, connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karimaed/).
