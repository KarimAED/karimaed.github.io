Hi there, I'm Karim!  
I am a fourth Year theoretical physics undergraduate student at Imperial College London,
and I am interested in machine learning and applying myself to interdisciplinary work in academia or industry.
Outside of studies and work, I like to volunteer, especially in working with children and other young people.
In my leisure, I like to read, code/program and do sports.
