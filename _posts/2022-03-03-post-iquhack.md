How to hack a quantum computer and make a game out of it.

# Setting the Stage
When I was selected for MIT's annual quantum hackathon iQuHack 2022,
there were a lot of different feelings that stirred in me. At the time,
I was battling a [mono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_mononucleosis)
infection, and there was only a week to go to the hack. I had no idea if
I would be able to attend. There was not a doubt in my mind that I wanted
to though. After having applied for the event, I completely forgot about
it, not even expecting to be accepted. When I did, all I could think of
was that I might still be unable to attend because of my health.  

Thus, the countdown began. Every day, I was getting a little better, and
every day the hackathon inched closer. In the end, I made it, but just barely.
I was still on painkillers for the first events on friday, but luckily by saturday
I felt just well enough to get going on this hack. The first challenge was overcome.
## The Challenge
As I was accepted into the MicrosoftxIonQ challenge of the hackathon, I excitedly
anticipated the release of the challenge goals. When I heard that we were supposed to
develop a game using a quantum computer, my first thought was: WHAT?? Where do we even start?

But quickly the wide scope of the challenge became an upside. We were given absolute
freedom to create something new. Ideas began to explode in my head, from platform games, to
games of chance, all relying on the quantum computer as a random number generator.
## The Squad
Luckily though, I wasn't left alone with my ideas. Otherwise, I would have undoubtedly chosen a
ridiculously overambitious project. My great team members [Francesco Scala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-scala-839507211/),
[Rabins Wosti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rabins-wosti-703107152/), and 
[Arunava Majumder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunava-majumder-33500a167/) luckily kept me on the ground.

We had met just the day before in the iQuHack slack channel, and connected only by shared passion,
we instantly formed a team.
